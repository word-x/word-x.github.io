Old HSK 2.0 test has 6 levels (1~6), but new HSK 3.0 test has 9 levels (1~9). Also, the vocabulary in each level changed greately. I recommend this New HSK Test Vocabulary 1-9 app. The only app on Google Play covers the vocabulary of 1~9 level (11,500+ words).</p><p><b>Keywords</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;NewHSK3.0, NewHSKTest3.0WordList, NewHSKVocabulary3.0</p><p><b>Update Time</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;5/25/2022 8:52:00 PM</p><script src="../../adcodes/SiteIntroBottom.js"></script>')
