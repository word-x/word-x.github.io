Also, the vocabulary in each level changed greately. I recommend this New HSK Test Vocabulary 1-9 app. The only app on Google Play covers the vocabulary of 1~9 level (11,500+ words).</p><p><b>关键词</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;NewHSK3.0, NewHSKTest3.0WordList, NewHSKVocabulary3.0</p><p><b>更新时间</b>&nbsp;:&nbsp;5/25/2022 8:42:00 PM</p><script src="../../adcodes/SiteIntroBottom.js"></script>')
